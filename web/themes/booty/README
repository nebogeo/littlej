Notes
---
*** STILL AN ALPHA VERSION; VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS

Booty is a theme for Ushahidi platform, v2.5.X. Unfortunately, previous versions of Ushahidi are not compatible with this theme as they used older versions of jQuery and due to the recent, extensive theme views restructuring.

Booty is based on the Twitter Bootstrap Framework: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap.
