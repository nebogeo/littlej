You can use ant, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or pretty much any IDE
to compile this library app. Before building, you should ensure that:

1) You've read the 'External Libraries' section below and have added the necessary
   JARs in 'Core/libs' directory to your build path.

2) Your Eclipse/IDEA/ant/etc. project targets API level 7(Google's) or
   higher.

Forgetting to do either of these will result in compile errors.
